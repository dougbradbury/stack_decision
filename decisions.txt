The specification decisions:
1) Stack is an object
2) Name is “Stack”
3) There is an operation to add an element
4) It is called “push”
5) It takes a parameter
6) The type of the parameter is the same as the type of the stack
7) Stack has a type parameter
8) There is an operation to remove elements
9) Its name is “pop”
10) Its return value is the same as the type of the stack
11) Elements are ordered LIFO

Here are the implementation decisions:
12) Store the elements in a List
13) Type of the list is the same as the type of the stack
14) Implementation type is ArrayList
15) Add/remove elements at the beginning of the list
